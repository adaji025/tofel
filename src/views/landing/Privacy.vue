        <div class="mt-2">
          The VTalk website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your
          online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard
          disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or
          deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
          you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued
          the cookie to you.
          <br /><br />
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
          feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
          server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
          personalize VTalk pages, or register with VTalk site or services, a
          cookie helps VTalk to recall your specific information on subsequent
          visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
          information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
          When you return to the same VTalk website, the information you
          previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the VTalk
          features that you customized.
          <br /><br />
          You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
          automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
          setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
          cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
          features of the VTalk services or websites you visit.
